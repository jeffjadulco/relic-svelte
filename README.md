# Relic: Reddit Live Comments

A simple web app to view a Reddit post's comments sorted by new and auto refresh every X seconds.

A.k.a Sports Mode

I made this tool to automate refreshing of r/formula1 live comments during race weekends. I think this will be useful if you want to view new comments of any post without reloading the browser.
